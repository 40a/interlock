The main process inside the container will be sent `SIGKILL`, or any
signal specified with option `--signal`.

> **Note:**
> `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` in the *shell* form run as a subcommand of `/bin/sh -c`,
> which does not pass signals. This means that the executable is not the containerâ€™s PID 1
> and does not receive Unix signals.
